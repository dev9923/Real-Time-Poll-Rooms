# ANTI_ABUSE_MECHANISMS

## Fairness Mechanisms Implemented

1. **Mechanism 1: User Rate Limiting**  
   To prevent abusive behavior and ensure fair participation, a user rate limiting mechanism is implemented. This restricts the number of actions (e.g., votes, comments) a user can perform within a specified time window. By enforcing these limits, it ensures that no single user can dominate the voting process, promoting a balanced and fair outcome.

2. **Mechanism 2: Randomized Selection of Participants**  
   This mechanism involves randomly selecting a subset of participants from the pool of eligible users to engage in specific actions. By ensuring that not all users can take part in every event or action, it helps mitigate the risk of abuse by spreading the opportunities across a wider range of users, thus fostering a more equitable environment.
